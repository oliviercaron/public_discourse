## French public discourse collection

### What is it ?

La Collection des discours publics, which translates to "The Collection of Public Speeches" in English, gathers more than 160,000 speeches delivered by key figures in French public life. This includes speeches by the President of the Republic since 1974, the Prime Minister and government members since the early 1980s, and communiqu√©s from the Council of Ministers since 1974, among others.

df_no_date2 <- df_combined %>% 
  filter(date == "" | is.na(date)) %>%
  select(page_number) %>%
  distinct()

#write vector to txt file
write.table(df_no_date2, "data/df_no_date2.txt", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
